## Common Issues - Quick Fixes

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Username Field Missing

**Issue:** Registration fails with "Aborting write to empty username" or "No user found and can't create new user"

**Root Cause:** The enrollment prompt stage is missing the **username** field.

**Quick Fix:** Jump to [Step 3: Add Username Field](#step-3-add-username-field-critical) below.

### Issue: New Users Can't Access Application

**Root Cause:** Users not assigned to required groups.

**Quick Fix:** Jump to [Step 5: Auto-Assign Users to Groups](#step-5-auto-assign-users-to-groups) below.

## Overview

By default, Authentik requires administrators to manually create user accounts. To allow users to register themselves, you need to:

1. ✅ Review or create the enrollment flow
2. ✅ Enable enrollment flow on your brand
3. ✅ **Add username field to the prompt stage** (CRITICAL!)
4. ✅ Configure the User Write stage to create users
5. ✅ **Auto-assign new users to default groups** (NEW!)
6. ✅ Test the complete registration flow
7. ⚙️ Optionally add email verification, password policies, etc.

**Estimated Time:** 15-20 minutes

## Prerequisites

- Authentik is running and accessible at `http://localhost:9000`
- You have admin access to Authentik
- The OAuth2 provider and application are configured
  - If not, see [provider-application-setup.md](./provider-application-setup.md)
- You have created user groups (optional but recommended)
  - If not, see [user-groups-permissions.md](./user-groups-permissions.md)

## Step 1: Review Default Enrollment Flow

Authentik comes with a default enrollment flow that's already configured. Let's review it:

1. **Login to Authentik** admin panel: `http://localhost:9000/`

2. Navigate to **Flows & Stages** → **Flows**

3. Look for a flow named `default-enrollment-flow` or `Welcome to authentik!`
   - If it exists, click on it to review
   - If it doesn't exist, proceed to "Creating a Custom Enrollment Flow" below

4. The default flow should include these stages:
   - **prompt-stage-enrollment** - Collects user information (username, name, email, password)
   - **user-write** - Creates the user in the database
   - **user-login** - Automatically logs the user in after registration

## Step 2: Enable Enrollment on Your Brand

1. In Authentik admin, navigate to **System** → **Brands**

2. Click on your brand (usually **authentik** or **default**)

3. Scroll to the **Flow settings** section

4. Configure the following:
   - **Enrollment flow**: Select `default-enrollment-flow` from the dropdown
   - **Recovery flow**: (Optional) Select `default-recovery-flow` for password reset
   - **Unenrollment flow**: (Optional) Select `default-unenrollment-flow` to allow users to delete accounts

5. Click **Update** at the bottom

## Step 3: Add Username Field (CRITICAL!)

**⚠️ This step is REQUIRED or registration will fail!**

### Option A: Add Username Prompt (Recommended)

1. **Navigate to Prompts:**
   - Go to **Flows & Stages** → **Prompts** (in the left sidebar)

2. **Check if username prompt exists:**
   - Look for a prompt with **Field Key** = `username`
   - If it exists, skip to step 4
   - If not, continue to step 3

3. **Create Username Prompt:**
   - Click **Create** button
   - Configure:
     - **Field Key**: `username` (must be exactly this!)
     - **Label**: `Username`
     - **Type**: `Text`
     - **Required**: ✅ **Checked**
     - **Placeholder**: `Choose a username`
     - **Order**: `0` (to show first)
     - **Help Text** (optional): `3-50 characters, letters and numbers only`
   - Click **Create**

4. **Add username to enrollment prompt stage:**
   - Navigate to **Flows & Stages** → **Stages**
   - Find and click on `enrollment-prompt` (or the prompt stage used in your enrollment flow)
   - In the **Fields** section, you'll see a multi-select list
   - **Add** the `username` field to the selected fields
   - **Order the fields** (drag or set order numbers):
     - Order 0: Username
     - Order 10: Email
     - Order 20: Name
     - Order 30: Password
     - Order 40: Password repeat
   - Click **Update**

5. **Verify the stage binding:**
   - Go to **Flows & Stages** → **Flows** → `default-enrollment-flow`
   - Click **Stage Bindings** tab
   - Ensure `enrollment-prompt` is bound with **Order 10** (before User Write stage)

### Option B: Use Email as Username (Alternative)

If you prefer users to login with email instead of a separate username:

1. **Navigate to User Write Stage:**
   - Go to **Flows & Stages** → **Stages**
   - Find and click on `default-user-settings-write` (or your enrollment user write stage)

2. **Check settings:**
   - Look for **"User Path Template"** or **"Username field"** settings
   - Some Authentik versions have **"Can create users"** checkbox - ensure it's checked
   - Some versions allow setting username source to `email` field

3. **Alternative approach - modify prompt:**
   - Instead of creating separate username field
   - Configure the User Write stage to use the `email` field as username
   - This requires custom stage configuration

**Note:** Option A (separate username) is recommended as it's more straightforward and standard.

## Step 4: Configure User Write Stage

The User Write stage is responsible for actually creating user accounts in the database.

### 4.1 Find the User Write Stage

1. **Navigate to Stages:**
   - Go to **Flows & Stages** → **Stages**

2. **Find the User Write stage:**
   - Look for the stage used in your enrollment flow
   - Common names: `default-user-settings-write`, `enrollment-user-write`, `user-write`
   - You can also check from: Flows → default-enrollment-flow → Stage Bindings tab

### 4.2 Verify User Write Configuration

1. **Click on the User Write stage** to edit it

2. **Verify these critical settings:**

   | Setting | Recommended Value | Why? |
   |---------|-------------------|------|
   | **Create users as inactive** | ❌ Unchecked | Users active immediately (unless using email verification) |
   | **User path template** | `users` | Where users are stored in Authentik's directory |
   | **Can create users** | ✅ Enabled | Stage can create new users (if option exists) |

### 4.3 If Using Email Verification

If you plan to add email verification ([email-verification.md](./email-verification.md)):

- **Create users as inactive**: ✅ **Checked**
- Email stage will activate users after verification

### 4.4 Create New User Write Stage (If Needed)

If the existing stage doesn't work or is misconfigured:

1. **Create a new User Write Stage:**
   - Click **Create** → **User Write Stage**

2. **Configure the stage:**
   - **Name**: `enrollment-user-write`
   - **Create users as inactive**: ❌ Unchecked (or ✅ if using email verification)
   - **User path template**: `users`

3. **Click Create**

4. **Update enrollment flow to use new stage:**
   - Go to **Flows & Stages** → **Flows** → `default-enrollment-flow`
   - Click **Stage Bindings** tab
   - Find the old User Write stage binding
   - Click **Edit** and change to `enrollment-user-write`
   - Or delete old binding and create new one

**✅ User Write stage configured!**

## Step 5: Auto-Assign Users to Groups

**NEW!** This critical step ensures new users are automatically added to default groups so they can access your application.

### 5.1 Why This Matters

Without group assignment:
- ❌ New users may not be able to access Portfolio Manager
- ❌ You'll need to manually add each user to groups
- ❌ Users get confused why they can't login

With auto-assignment:
- ✅ New users immediately get appropriate access
- ✅ Automatic onboarding - no manual work
- ✅ Better user experience

### 5.2 Prerequisites: Create User Groups

First, ensure you have groups created (if not done already):

1. **Navigate to** **Directory** → **Groups**

2. **Create a "users" group** (if not exists):
   - Click **Create**
   - **Name**: `users`
   - **Label**: `Standard Users`
   - Click **Create**

For more details on groups, see [user-groups-permissions.md](./user-groups-permissions.md).

### 5.3 Configure User Write Stage to Assign Groups

Now configure the User Write stage to automatically add new users to groups:

1. **Navigate to** **Flows & Stages** → **Stages**

2. **Click on your User Write stage** (e.g., `user-write` or `enrollment-user-write`)

3. **Scroll down to the "Groups" section**

4. **Click "Add Group" or select from dropdown**:
   - Select `users` (or your default group)
   - You can add multiple groups if needed

5. **Click "Update"** to save

### 5.4 Verify Configuration

1. Go to **Flows & Stages** → **Flows** → `default-enrollment-flow`
2. Click **Stage Bindings** tab
3. Click on the User Write stage
4. Verify **Groups** section shows `users` (or your group)

**✅ Auto-assignment configured!** New users will automatically be added to the `users` group.

## Step 6: Test Enrollment Flow

Now let's test the complete enrollment process to verify everything works.

### 6.1 Access Enrollment Page

1. **Logout** from Authentik admin (or open an incognito window)

2. **Access the enrollment URL**:
   - Direct: `http://localhost:9000/if/flow/default-enrollment-flow/`
   - Or via Portfolio Manager: `http://localhost:3000` → Click "Register"

### 6.2 Fill Registration Form

You should see a registration form with these fields:

- ✅ **Username** (if you completed Step 3)
- ✅ **Email**
- ✅ **Name** (full name)
- ✅ **Password**
- ✅ **Password confirmation**

**Fill in test data:**
```
Username: testuser123
Email: your-email@example.com (use a real email you can check)
Name: Test User
Password: TestPassword123!
Password confirmation: TestPassword123!
```

### 6.3 Submit Registration

1. **Click** "Sign up" or "Submit" button

2. **Expected result:**
   - ✅ No errors
   - ✅ Redirected to success page or auto-logged in
   - ✅ See Authentik user dashboard or Portfolio Manager app

### 6.4 Verify User Was Created

1. **Login** to Authentik admin panel

2. **Navigate to** **Directory** → **Users**

3. **Find** the test user (`testuser123`)

4. **Click** on the user to view details

5. **Verify:**
   - ✅ **Status**: Active (green checkmark)
   - ✅ **Username**: `testuser123`
   - ✅ **Email**: matches what you entered
   - ✅ **Groups** tab: Shows `users` group (if you configured Step 5)

**✅ If you see the user with active status and in the correct group, enrollment is working!**

### 6.5 Test Login to Portfolio Manager

1. **Go to** `http://localhost:3000`

2. **Click** "Login"

3. **Enter credentials:**
   - Username: `testuser123`
   - Password: `TestPassword123!`

4. **Expected result:**
   - ✅ Redirected to Authentik login
   - ✅ Successfully authenticated
   - ✅ Redirected back to Portfolio Manager
   - ✅ Logged in and can access the application

**✅ Complete enrollment and authentication flow working!**

## Optional Enhancements

## Frontend Integration

The Portfolio Manager frontend already supports enrollment! When users click "Register" they'll be redirected to:

```
http://localhost:9000/if/flow/default-enrollment-flow/
```

After successful registration, they can:
1. Login using the credentials they created
2. Access the Portfolio Manager application

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Aborting write to empty username"

**Cause:** Username field not included in prompt stage.

**Solution:** Follow [Step 3: Add Username Field](#step-3-add-username-field-critical) carefully.

### Error: "No user found and can't create new user"

**Cause:** User Write stage not configured to create users.

**Solution:**
1. Check User Write stage settings (Step 4)
2. Ensure "Can create users" is enabled
3. Or create new User Write stage specifically for enrollment

### New Users Can't Access Portfolio Manager

**Cause:** Users not assigned to required groups.

**Solution:**
1. Follow [Step 5: Auto-Assign Users to Groups](#step-5-auto-assign-users-to-groups)
2. Or manually add users to groups: Directory → Users → [user] → Groups tab

### Registration Form Missing Username Field

**Cause:** Username prompt not added to enrollment prompt stage.

**Solution:**
1. Flows & Stages → Prompts → Create username prompt (field key: `username`)
2. Flows & Stages → Stages → enrollment-prompt → Add username field
3. Save and test again

### Enrollment URL shows 404

- **Check flow exists**: Navigate to Flows & Stages → Flows and verify `default-enrollment-flow` exists
- **Check designation**: Make sure the flow's designation is set to "Enrollment"
- **Check slug**: The URL uses the flow's slug, verify it's `default-enrollment-flow`

### Users can't see enrollment link on login page

- **Check brand settings**: System → Brands → Your brand → Enrollment flow must be set
- **Use direct URL**: Share `http://localhost:9000/if/flow/default-enrollment-flow/` directly

### Email verification not working

- **Check SMTP settings**: System → Settings → Email configuration
- **Test email**: Click "Test" button in email settings
- **Check logs**: `podman compose logs -f portfolio-authentik-server`
- **For development**: Consider skipping email verification or using Mailhog

### Password policy too strict

- **Edit policy**: Policies → Your password policy → Reduce requirements
- **Or remove policy**: Flows → Your enrollment flow → Policies tab → Delete binding

### Users are created but can't login to Portfolio Manager

- **Check scopes**: Make sure the OAuth2 provider has `openid`, `email`, `profile` scopes
- **Check application**: The application must be linked to the provider
- **Check client ID**: Must match `portfolio-manager`
- **Check backend logs**: `podman compose logs -f portfolio-backend`
