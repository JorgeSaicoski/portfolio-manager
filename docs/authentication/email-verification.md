## Why Email Verification?

Email verification provides several benefits:

**Security:**
- Confirms users own the email address they registered with
- Prevents registration with fake or mistyped email addresses
- Reduces spam and bot registrations

**Communication:**
- Ensures you can reach users for password resets
- Validates email for important notifications
- Maintains clean email list (no bounces)

**Compliance:**
- Demonstrates user consent (GDPR, CAN-SPAM)
- Provides audit trail of verified users
- Reduces liability from invalid contacts

**User Experience:**
- Prevents typos in email addresses
- Ensures users can recover their accounts
- Builds trust with professional process

## Prerequisites

- Authentik is running and accessible at `http://localhost:9000`
- You have admin access to Authentik
- **Email is configured** (SMTP, SES, or SendGrid)
  - If not, see [email-configuration.md](./email-configuration.md) first
- Enrollment flow is configured
  - If not, see [enrollment-setup.md](./enrollment-setup.md) first

## Step 1: Configure Email Backend

Before setting up verification, ensure email is working.

### 1.1 Verify Email Configuration

1. **Login to Authentik** admin: `http://localhost:9000/`
2. Navigate to **System** → **Settings**
3. Scroll to **Email** section
4. Verify these settings are filled in:
   - From address
   - Host
   - Port
   - Username
   - Password
   - Use TLS (usually checked)

### 1.2 Test Email Sending

1. In the Email section, click **Test** button
2. Check your inbox for the test email
3. If test fails, see [email-configuration.md](./email-configuration.md)

**✅ Email must be working before continuing!**

## Step 2: Create Email Verification Stage

Now we'll create a stage that sends verification emails.

### 2.1 Navigate to Stages

1. In Authentik admin, navigate to **Flows & Stages** → **Stages**
2. You'll see a list of existing stages
3. Click **Create** button (top right)

### 2.2 Select Stage Type

1. A dropdown will appear with stage types
2. Select **Email Stage**
3. The stage configuration form will open

### 2.3 Configure Email Stage

Fill in the following settings:

| Field | Value | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| **Name** | `enrollment-email-verification` | Descriptive name for this stage |
| **Subject** | `Verify your email address` | Email subject line |
| **Template** | `email/account_confirmation.html` | Built-in template |
| **Activate pending user** | ✅ Checked | **CRITICAL**: Enable user after verification |
| **Use global settings** | ✅ Checked | Use email config from System → Settings |
| **Token expiry** | `30` | Minutes before link expires |
| **From address** | (leave empty to use global) | Or override with specific address |

### 2.4 Understanding Key Settings

**Activate pending user:**
- **Checked**: User account created as inactive, activated after email verification
- **Unchecked**: User account active immediately, but email sent for confirmation
- **Recommended**: ✅ Checked (activate after verification)

**Token expiry:**
- How long the verification link remains valid
- **Too short**: Users might not verify in time
- **Too long**: Security risk if email compromised
- **Recommended**: 30 minutes to 24 hours (1440 minutes)

**Template:**
- `email/account_confirmation.html` - Default verification email
- You can create custom templates (see [Customization](#customization-options))

### 2.5 Create the Stage

1. **Review all settings**
2. Click **Create** button at the bottom
3. You should see the stage in the list

**✅ Email verification stage created!**

## Step 3: Add Stage to Enrollment Flow

Now we need to add this stage to the enrollment flow.

### 3.1 Navigate to Enrollment Flow

1. Navigate to **Flows & Stages** → **Flows**
2. Find your enrollment flow (usually `default-enrollment-flow`)
3. Click on the flow name

### 3.2 View Current Stage Bindings

1. Click the **Stage Bindings** tab
2. You should see existing stages like:
   - Order 10: `prompt-stage-enrollment` (collects user info)
   - Order 20: `user-write` (creates user)
   - Order 30: `user-login` (logs user in)

**Note:** Order numbers determine execution sequence (lower = earlier).

### 3.3 Determine Where to Insert Email Stage

**Option A: Verify Before Creating User (Recommended)**

```
Order 10: Prompt (collect email, password, etc.)
Order 15: Email Verification ← NEW
Order 20: User Write (create user after verification)
Order 30: User Login
```

**Pros:**
- Only creates user if email is valid
- No inactive users in database
- Cleaner user list

**Cons:**
- User must verify before account exists
- Can't login until verified

**Option B: Verify After Creating User (Alternative)**

```
Order 10: Prompt (collect email, password, etc.)
Order 20: User Write (create user as inactive)
Order 25: Email Verification ← NEW
Order 30: User Login (after activation)
```

**Pros:**
- User account exists immediately
- Can track unverified users
- Can resend verification emails

**Cons:**
- Creates inactive users in database
- Needs cleanup of never-verified accounts

**Recommendation:** Use Option A for new setups.

### 3.4 Add Email Stage Binding

1. On the **Stage Bindings** tab, click **Bind Stage** button

2. Configure the binding:

   | Field | Value | Notes |
   |-------|-------|-------|
   | **Stage** | `enrollment-email-verification` | Select from dropdown |
   | **Order** | `15` | Between prompt (10) and user-write (20) |
   | **Re-evaluate policies** | ✅ Checked (optional) | Re-check policies before this stage |
   | **Invalid response behavior** | `Retry` | What to do if stage fails |

3. Click **Create**

### 3.5 Adjust User Write Stage (Important!)

If using Option A (verify before user creation), the User Write stage should create active users.

1. On the **Stage Bindings** tab, find the **User Write** stage
2. Click on the stage name (e.g., `user-write`)
3. In the stage configuration:
   - **Create users as inactive**: ❌ **Unchecked**
   - (User will be created active after email verification)
4. Click **Update**

If using Option B (verify after user creation):

1. Find the **User Write** stage configuration
2. **Create users as inactive**: ✅ **Checked**
3. **Activate pending user** (in email stage): ✅ **Checked**

### 3.6 Review Final Flow

The flow should now look like this:

```
default-enrollment-flow
├── [10] prompt-stage-enrollment
│   └── Collect: username, email, password
├── [15] enrollment-email-verification ← NEW
│   └── Send verification email
├── [20] user-write
│   └── Create user account
└── [30] user-login
    └── Log user in
```

**✅ Email verification added to enrollment flow!**

## Step 4: Test Email Verification

Now let's test the complete flow.

### 4.1 Start Enrollment

1. **Logout** from Authentik (or open incognito window)

2. **Navigate to enrollment:**
   - Direct URL: `http://localhost:9000/if/flow/default-enrollment-flow/`
   - Or from Portfolio Manager: `http://localhost:3000` → Click "Register"

### 4.2 Fill Registration Form

1. Fill in the form:
   - **Username**: `testuser123`
   - **Email**: Use a real email you can check
   - **Name**: `Test User`
   - **Password**: (create a password)
   - **Password confirmation**: (same password)

2. Click **Sign up** or **Submit**

### 4.3 Check for Verification Email

1. **You should see a message:**
   ```
   A verification email has been sent to your email address.
   Please check your inbox and click the verification link.
   ```

2. **Check your email inbox** (including spam folder)

3. **You should receive an email:**
   - **From**: Your configured "from address"
   - **Subject**: "Verify your email address"
   - **Body**: Contains a verification link

4. **Click the verification link** in the email

### 4.4 Complete Verification

After clicking the link:

1. **You should be redirected** to Authentik
2. **You should see a success message:**
   ```
   Email verified successfully!
   ```
3. **You should be automatically logged in** (if flow continues)
4. **You should be redirected** to Portfolio Manager

### 4.5 Verify User is Active

1. **Login to Authentik** admin
2. Navigate to **Directory** → **Users**
3. Find the test user (`testuser123`)
4. Click on the user
5. **Verify**:
   - **Status**: Active (should have a green checkmark)
   - **Email**: Should be listed
   - **Last login**: Should show recent timestamp

**✅ If all steps worked, email verification is configured correctly!**

## Customization Options

### Custom Email Subject

Change the email subject line:

1. Navigate to **Flows & Stages** → **Stages**
2. Click on `enrollment-email-verification`
3. Change **Subject** field:
   - `Welcome to Portfolio Manager - Verify Your Email`
   - `Confirm your email for Portfolio Manager`
   - `[Portfolio Manager] Please verify your email`
4. Click **Update**

### Custom Token Expiry

Change how long verification links remain valid:

1. Edit the email stage
2. Change **Token expiry** field:
   - `10` = 10 minutes (fast verification required)
   - `60` = 1 hour (reasonable)
   - `1440` = 24 hours (relaxed)
   - `10080` = 7 days (very relaxed)
3. Click **Update**

**Recommendation**: 30-60 minutes for security, 24 hours for convenience.

### Custom Email Template

Create a custom verification email template:

#### Option 1: Override Default Template

1. **Create custom template file:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ./authentik-templates/email
   nano ./authentik-templates/email/account_confirmation.html
   ```

2. **Add custom HTML:**
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
       <meta charset="utf-8">
       <title>Verify your email</title>
       <style>
           body {
               font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
               line-height: 1.6;
               color: #333;
               max-width: 600px;
               margin: 0 auto;
               padding: 20px;
           }
           .header {
               background: #007bff;
               color: white;
               padding: 20px;
               text-align: center;
           }
           .content {
               padding: 20px;
               background: #f9f9f9;
           }
           .button {
               display: inline-block;
               padding: 12px 24px;
               background: #007bff;
               color: white;
               text-decoration: none;
               border-radius: 4px;
               margin: 20px 0;
           }
           .footer {
               font-size: 12px;
               color: #666;
               text-align: center;
               padding: 20px;
           }
       </style>
   </head>
   <body>
       <div class="header">
           <h1>Welcome to Portfolio Manager!</h1>
       </div>
       <div class="content">
           <p>Hi {{ username }},</p>
           <p>Thanks for signing up! We're excited to have you on board.</p>
           <p>To complete your registration, please verify your email address by clicking the button below:</p>

               <a href="{{ url }}" class="button">Verify Email Address</a>
           </p>
           <p>Or copy and paste this link into your browser:</p>
           <p style="word-break: break-all; color: #007bff;">{{ url }}</p>
           <p><strong>This link will expire in {{ expires }} minutes.</strong></p>
           <p>If you didn't create an account with us, please ignore this email.</p>
       </div>
       <div class="footer">
           <p>&copy; 2024 Portfolio Manager. All rights reserved.</p>
           <p>This is an automated message, please do not reply.</p>
       </div>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

3. **Mount template in docker-compose:**
   ```yaml
   services:
     portfolio-authentik-server:
       volumes:
         - ./authentik-templates:/templates:ro
   ```

4. **Restart Authentik:**
   ```bash
   podman compose restart portfolio-authentik-server
   ```

#### Option 2: Create New Template

1. Create new template: `./authentik-templates/email/custom_verification.html`
2. Mount templates (same as above)
3. Edit email stage:
   - Change **Template** to `email/custom_verification.html`
4. Restart and test

### Available Template Variables

Use these variables in your custom templates:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `{{ username }}` | User's username | `johndoe` |
| `{{ user.email }}` | User's email | `john@example.com` |
| `{{ user.name }}` | User's full name | `John Doe` |
| `{{ url }}` | Verification URL | `http://localhost:9000/if/...` |
| `{{ expires }}` | Minutes until expiry | `30` |

### Custom From Address

Override the global email settings:

1. Edit the email stage
2. Uncheck **Use global settings**
3. Fill in **From address**: `verify@yourdomain.com`
4. Optionally configure separate SMTP settings
5. Click **Update**

**Use case**: Different sender for verification vs. notifications.

## Troubleshooting

### Verification Email Not Received

**Check spam folder:**
- Verification emails often flagged as spam
- Add sender to whitelist/safe senders

**Check email configuration:**
```bash
# View Authentik logs
podman compose logs portfolio-authentik-server | grep -i email
```

**Verify stage is in flow:**
1. Flows & Stages → Flows → Enrollment flow
2. Stage Bindings tab
3. Confirm email stage is listed and bound

**Test email sending:**
1. System → Settings → Email section
2. Click "Test" button
3. If test fails, fix email config first

### Verification Link Expired

**Cause**: Token expiry too short or user delayed verification.

**Solution:**

1. **Increase token expiry:**
   - Edit email stage
   - Set **Token expiry** to `1440` (24 hours)

2. **Resend verification email:**
   - Future enhancement: Add "Resend" button
   - For now: User must re-register

### Verification Link Returns 404

**Cause**: Invalid token or flow issue.

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Authentik logs:**
   ```bash
   podman compose logs portfolio-authentik-server
   ```

2. **Verify URL format:**
   - Should be: `http://localhost:9000/if/flow/default-enrollment-flow/?token=...`

3. **Check flow still exists:**
   - Flows & Stages → Flows
   - Confirm enrollment flow is active

### User Account Not Activated

**Cause**: "Activate pending user" not checked.

**Solution:**

1. Edit email stage
2. Enable **Activate pending user** ✅
3. Test with new registration

**Manually activate user:**
1. Directory → Users → Find user
2. Click Edit
3. Check **Is active** checkbox
4. Save

### Multiple Verification Emails Sent

**Cause**: Stage bound multiple times or flow loops.

**Solution:**

1. Check stage bindings:
   - Flows & Stages → Flows → Enrollment flow
   - Stage Bindings tab
   - Remove duplicate email stage bindings

2. Check flow doesn't loop back

### Verification Email in Wrong Language

**Cause**: User's browser language differs from desired language.

**Solution:**

Authentik uses browser language by default. To force a language:

1. **Set default language:**
   - System → Settings
   - Set **Default locale**

2. **Or use custom template** with hardcoded language

### Link Doesn't Auto-Login User

**Cause**: User Login stage not in flow or positioned incorrectly.

**Solution:**

1. Check flow has User Login stage:
   - Flows & Stages → Flows → Enrollment flow
   - Stage Bindings tab
   - Add User Login stage if missing

2. Ensure User Login is AFTER email verification

3. Check stage order:
   ```
   10: Prompt
   15: Email Verification
   20: User Write
   30: User Login ← Should be last
   ```

## Production Best Practices

### Token Expiry

- **Development**: 24 hours (1440 minutes) - convenient for testing
- **Production**: 30-60 minutes - better security
- **High security**: 10 minutes - very strict

### Email Content

- **Clear subject**: "Verify your email for [App Name]"
- **Include branding**: Logo, colors, company info
- **Plain text version**: For email clients that don't support HTML
- **Mobile friendly**: Responsive design
- **Clear CTA**: Big, obvious verification button

### Security

- **Use HTTPS** for verification URLs in production
- **Log verification attempts** for audit trail
- **Rate limit**: Prevent email bombing
- **Monitor bounces**: Track invalid email addresses

### User Experience

- **Show clear message** after registration
- **Provide support link** if email not received
- **Allow resend** verification email (future enhancement)
- **Auto-login** after successful verification
- **Remember devices** (optional) to skip re-verification

### Cleanup

**Remove unverified users** after a time period:

1. Create scheduled task to query inactive users
2. Delete users inactive > 7 days with unverified email
3. Or: Send reminder email, then delete after 14 days

### Monitoring

Track:
- **Verification rate**: % of users who verify
- **Time to verify**: How quickly users verify
- **Bounce rate**: Invalid email addresses
- **Expired tokens**: Users hitting expired links

### Compliance

- **GDPR**: Document email usage in privacy policy
- **Retention**: Don't keep emails of unverified/deleted users
- **Consent**: Email verification implies consent for transactional emails

## Next Steps

After setting up email verification:

1. **Test thoroughly** with multiple email providers (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
2. **[Configure User Groups](./user-groups-permissions.md)** - Organize verified users
3. **Setup password reset flow** - Uses similar email stage
4. **Monitor verification rates** - Track how many users complete verification
5. **Customize email template** - Match your branding
6. **Add resend functionality** - Let users request new verification emails
