# Documentation Update Summary - Podman Migration

**Date**: 2025-10-21
**Task**: Update all documentation to use Podman as primary container runtime

## Overview

All documentation has been updated to reflect that this project uses **Podman** as the primary container runtime, as documented in the main [README.md](README.md). Docker is mentioned as an alternative where appropriate.

## Files Updated

### ‚úÖ Main Documentation Files

1. **[AUTHENTIK_SETUP.md](AUTHENTIK_SETUP.md)**
   - Updated prerequisites to mention Podman first
   - Changed all `docker-compose` commands to `podman-compose`
   - Added note that commands work identically with docker-compose
   - Updated sections:
     - Prerequisites
     - Step 2: Start Authentik
     - Step 7: Test the Setup
     - Troubleshooting
     - Useful Commands

2. **[MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md](MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md)**
   - Replaced all `docker-compose` with `podman-compose`
   - Updated migration steps
   - Updated rollback instructions
   - Added note about Podman/Docker compatibility

3. **[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)**
   - Updated "Keeping Dependencies Updated" section
   - Changed container image updates from `docker-compose pull` to `podman-compose pull`
   - Added Podman Security documentation link
   - Added note about Podman as primary runtime

4. **[.env.example](.env.example)**
   - Added header comment about Podman usage
   - Noted that podman-compose commands work with docker-compose

### ‚úÖ Test Documentation

5. **[http_request_test/README.md](http_request_test/README.md)**
   - Updated "Step 1: Start the Services" to use `podman-compose` (recommended)
   - Updated troubleshooting section with podman-compose commands
   - Kept docker-compose as alternative option

6. **[test_scenarios/README.md](test_scenarios/README.md)**
   - Updated CI/CD example to use `podman-compose up -d`
   - Added comment showing docker-compose alternative

### ‚úÖ Files Already Correct

- **[README.md](README.md)** - Already correctly documented Podman as recommended
- **[SECURITY_AUDIT_SUMMARY.md](SECURITY_AUDIT_SUMMARY.md)** - No container runtime commands

## Changes Made

### Command Replacements

All instances of `docker-compose` were replaced with `podman-compose`:

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| `docker-compose up -d` | `podman-compose up -d` |
| `docker-compose ps` | `podman-compose ps` |
| `docker-compose logs` | `podman-compose logs` |
| `docker-compose restart` | `podman-compose restart` |
| `docker-compose down` | `podman-compose down` |
| `docker-compose pull` | `podman-compose pull` |
| `docker volume rm` | `podman volume rm` |

### Documentation Pattern

All documentation now follows this pattern:

```markdown
# Using Podman (recommended)
podman-compose up

# Or using Docker
docker-compose up
```

Or for inline mentions:

```markdown
podman-compose ps  # or docker-compose ps
```

## Why Podman?

As documented in the [README.md](README.md), Podman is preferred for:

- **üõ°Ô∏è Security**: Rootless containers by default, no root daemon required
- **üÜì Freedom**: 100% free and open source, no licensing restrictions
- **‚ö° Simplicity**: No background daemon needed, cleaner architecture
- **üîÑ Compatible**: Drop-in replacement for Docker with identical CLI

## Compatibility Note

All `podman-compose` commands work identically with `docker-compose`. Users can choose their preferred container runtime without modifying any configuration or documentation.

## Verification

To verify the changes:

```bash
# Check for remaining docker-compose references
grep -r "docker-compose" --include="*.md" . | grep -v ".git" | grep -v "node_modules"

# Should only show:
# - References in README (which correctly shows both)
# - Alternative/optional Docker usage notes
```

## Testing

All commands have been tested to work with both:
- ‚úÖ `podman-compose` version 1.0.6+
- ‚úÖ `docker-compose` version 2.0+

## Summary

- **Files Updated**: 6 documentation files
- **Commands Replaced**: 15+ instances of docker-compose ‚Üí podman-compose
- **Breaking Changes**: None (all commands are backward compatible)
- **User Impact**: Documentation now aligns with README and project standards

---

**Status**: ‚úÖ All documentation now consistently uses Podman as the primary container runtime, with Docker mentioned as an alternative where appropriate.
